NAME
       dos2unix - DOS to UNIX file conversion

SYNTAX
       dos2unix {-q -d } filename filename ...

       dos2unix {-h -v}

Options
       -q     Quiet mode

       -d     Include debug messages in output to STDOUT

       -h     Show program usage information

       -v     Show program version information


DESCRIPTION
       The  dos2unix  program  will  convert  line-endings  of text files from
       DOS/Windows-style to UNIX-style. This conversion is useful when  trans-
       ferring text files from a DOS/Windows system to a UNIX System.

       If the file already has UNIX-style line-endings, no change will result.


INTERACTIONS
       The program processes named files only, and  therefore  cannot  process
       data through pipelines.
