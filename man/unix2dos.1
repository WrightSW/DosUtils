       The _u_n_i_x_2_d_o_s program will convert line-endings of text files from UNIX-
       style to DOS/Windows-style. This conversion is useful when transferring
       text files from a UNIX system to a DOS/Windows system.

       If  the file already has DOS-style line-endings, no change will result.

       The program processes named files only, and  therefore  cannot  process
       data through pipelines.
