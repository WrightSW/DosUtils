NAME
       unix2dos - UNIX to DOS file conversion

SYNTAX
       unix2dos {-q -d } filename filename ...

       unix2dos {-h -v}

Options
       -q     Quiet mode

       -d     Include debug messages in output to STDOUT

       -h     Show program usage information

       -v     Show program version information


DESCRIPTION
       The unix2dos program will convert line-endings of text files from UNIX-
       style to DOS/Windows-style. This conversion is useful when transferring
       text files from a UNIX system to a DOS/Windows system.

       If  the file already has DOS-style line-endings, no change will result.


INTERACTIONS
       The program processes named files only, and  therefore  cannot  process
       data through pipelines.
