       The  _d_o_s_2_u_n_i_x  program  will  convert  line-endings  of text files from
       DOS/Windows-style to UNIX-style. This conversion is useful when  trans-
       ferring text files from a DOS/Windows system to a UNIX System.

       If the file already has UNIX-style line-endings, no change will result.

       The program processes named files only, and  therefore  cannot  process
       data through pipelines.
